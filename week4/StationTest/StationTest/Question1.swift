Q1. Why does the instructor in the video create another view model named CurrentWeatherViewModel ​ instead of using ​CurrentWeather​ itself ?
 
    by seperate CurrentWeatherViewModel from CurrentWeather​, we can make our code more reusable,
    CurrentWeather can focus on get JSON data from web, CurrentWeatherViewModel to operate
    and process by ViewController to show or appear processed data on the UI interface.
